# Declan Casey Software Portfolio
Welcome to my Software Portfolio! It is located @ https://declanjcasey.github.io and the template was found at html5up, https://html5up.net/massively. This is only my first portfolio and while there are still many aspects that I'd like to differently or improve upon, I'm happy to say I am ready for recruiters, hiring managers, and software developers to go through and check out my work. 

The goal of this portfolio was to keep it as simple as possible, and my guiding idea during development was "humility." I am still a young student that is eager to learn and grow as a developer and software engineer, so I don't want to make myself out to be any more than I am. Trying to make myself out to be a far more accomplished developer than I actually am would not feel right, and I'm sure anyone to log would see right through it. I'd rather let the work I've completed and the experience I have show I have the foundations to grow into the industry, despite not having the lengthiest portfolio around.

I decided to keep the layout of my porfolio as simple as possible, without too many redirecting pages and links inside the site itself. I have my github, linkedin, and different projects linked directly to the home page.
